# “Encouraging Moms” Business Requirements

## Executive Summary

This document will provide the structure and direction for a mobile app & web application creation for encouraging, connecting, and uplifting moms all over. This project will be referred to “Encouraging Moms” throughout this document. The goals for this document are to bring together the thoughts and ideas that have been rolling around in my head that God has given me a passion for, and put it in an organized fashion so we can begin to launch this amazing mobile app and web application to encourage and uplift Moms.

## Business Objectives

The main objective for “Encouraging Moms” is to have create a place where moms can connect and be encouraged. In many ways, it will be a lifeline for moms. There will be a mobile app and web application which will all free for moms to use, there will be no monthly subscription or service fee.

## Background

This project is being initiated because there are so many moms out there that are just surviving with parenting and my heart just goes out to them. My heart is for them to thrive, enjoy parenting, and being with their kids. I also know that every mom out there has some great successful ideas with parenting, and I want to be able to create somewhere where they can share, and they can gain wisdom from each other.

## Scope

“Encouraging Moms” will be built on and have Christian foundations, so it will reach mainly young Christians moms. The main goal is not to connect moms, but to support and encourage young moms. However, I believe one of the ways to support and encourage moms is through connections with other moms. This is not a social media app or site.
As of right now, I don’t have a specific system(s) we will use to create this app, I’m open to ideas. However, for now we’ll plan on using Angular and Ionic for our mobile app.


## Functional requirements

Functional requirements for "Encouraging Moms" are as follows:
-	A place where moms can login and out
-	A profile where they can put the city/state they live in and any other personal information they feel comfortable sharing to be able to connect and possibly get together and/or have arrange times playdates for their kids.
-	A place where moms are able to post advise and tips in parenting anywhere from craft ideas to different potty-training techniques, and then moms will be able to search for tips and advice using key words to read what others have posted.
-	A place where moms can post (share) prayer requests and see when people are praying for them.
-	A place where moms can share praise reports.
-	A place where moms can post the need for encouragement and others can respond.
-	A place where moms can post funny stories and jokes and others can read them and get a good laugh.
This mobile app and web application needs to be running smoothly and quickly with the rare case erros. "Encouraging Moms" needs be be easy to use and get around on.


## Personnel requirements

I don’t think we need dedicated development. My rough approximate number of people on a time will be 5-10 people (this is my first project) who have the same vision I have…”to encourage and uplift moms”.  I believe in order to make a successful mobile app and web application, there should be some moms on our team to give us input on what would be helpful and what wouldn’t. I have never been a mom, so I don’t know what everything they do and do not struggle with.

## Delivery schedule

Our tentative schedule is:
1.	Planning and Brainstorming (Requirements): 4-5 weeks
2.	Rough Look/Draft/Routing (Design): 4-6 weeks 
3.	Creation of the web application (Implementation): 4-6 weeks
4.	Creation of the mobile app (Implementations): 4-6 weeks
5.	Verifying and Debugging (Verification): 3-4 weeks
6.	Upkeep (Maintenance): Continuous after launch
The plan is to try to meet up to 2-3 times a week via in person or video call.


## Other requirements

“Encouraging Moms” is planned to be supported on both android and apple devices. It needs to be pretty bug free and running really smoothly, so it won’t cause lots problems. I don’t want it to be hard for moms to use because time can be pretty scarce as a mom.

## Assumptions

I’m not thinking of any outside sources or services we will use as of now. I am open to ideas…like possibly already having a database of tips/advise and humor.

## Limitations

I’m not sure about the cost scope of this project, I don’t even have a ballpark. 
I have written some things down as a rough estimate for the timeline, but I know I could be totally off because I am not planning to have any dedicated development. This project will be more like a on the side project than a big full-time job project. So, time could definitely be a limitation.


## Risks

The major risk is that this is my first time doing anything like this. I have an idea and I want to implement it, but I’m not sure exactly how to go about it, and if it will even work. 
Another risk is that this may not be something moms are interested in or want to be invested in. So, I believe we should take a poll on moms to see how big the interest level is for this about  mobile app and web application. Another risk I see is the vision and reason for me creating this app…I don’t want it to be misunderstood or changed. This mobile app and web application is not to say which parenting way is the best or that all moms have to follow a particular ways or advice. It’s to give ideas. All posts will be kind or else deleted. This app is to encourage and uplift, and anything short of that will not be accepted. I think it’s important to have people with the same vision working on the team. And communication will be key with whatever team is composed.
